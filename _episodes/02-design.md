title: "Understanding experimental design"
teaching: 20
exercises: 10
questions:
- How many replicates do I need?
- What controls do I need
- What are sequence coverage and depth
- What can I afford
objectives:
- understand the difference between biological and technical replication   
- understand important of controls
- understand depth and coverage
- Identify best choices when budget is limited
keypoints:
- "X,Y,Z are important and should be looked at when deigning experiments"

# Controls

type depends on experiment and question

examples
- wildtype aganst gene knockout/modification
- characterisation of cell types
- treatments vs no treatment
- genome of bacteria cutured vs in a plant host
- genome of host with and without infection by bacteria


# Replication
general


## Biologicial replication
Most biologists instinctively appreciate the importance of biological replication to ensure that experimental results generalise. If we compare one wildtype plant against one geneticaly modified plant

## Technical Replication
measurement accuracy

control every aspect of variablity that you can. sample prep etc

what is downstream analysis - a particular software may have demands.

## Effect of replication on statistical analysis

depends on variation
calculation of, source of the  n = 3 rule
for signifcance, variation within groups < variation between group
some variation can be controlled, some is inherent. control as much as you can
importance of controlling as much variation as possible = fewer replicates needed. increasing more variation that is strictly requires greater replication.


## Pseudoreplication

# Budget
number of samples
number of reps
availability of equipment
might need to amend your question to meet budget
