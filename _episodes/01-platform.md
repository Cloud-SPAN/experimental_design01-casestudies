title: "Case Study 1 --- something great here"
teaching: 20
exercises: 10
questions:
- "What things can we can control in an experiment that can influence the power of the dataset?"
- "What things might limit the usefulness of a dataset that we might not be able to control?"
objectives:
- Identify what parts of experimental design we can control, and potential areas that will impact on the usefulness of the data collected, but we have no control over

keypoints:
- There are things that can reduce the usefulness of data collected from a experiment downstream
- Some of these can be accounted for, others can't be.

# Outline
choice of long vs short reads

depends on your research question

if you have a very good reference - short reads fine, can do lots of samples, thus quite a few exp conditions
if you are doing assemblies - long reads better, then to get depth do few samples
depends on size of genome and one ploidy
eg snp calling on bacteria need not be deep, hetero snps on what - need depth
