# Outline
Long read technology - currently nanopore and pacbio are the leading technologies. Short reads are typically 150-300bp in length, and the DNA needs to be broken into smaller fragments during the library process, either through chemical means or through sonication. In contrast long reads are not broken down and are often several kb in length, 10-30kb fragments common in good quality sample cases. Currently the longest read length for a nanopore run is 2.3Mb https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/312256v1.full.

Short read technology - most short read sequencing is currently done by illumina. [link to how this works?]

depends on your research question

if you have a very good reference - short reads fine, can do lots of samples, thus quite a few exp conditions
if you are doing assemblies - long reads better, then to get depth do few samples
depends on size of genome and one ploidy
eg snp calling on bacteria need not be deep, hetero snps on what - need depth
de novo needs more coverage
genome content - repetitiveness effect on assembly
